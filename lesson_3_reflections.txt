When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is great for collaboration. You can have multiple people working within one repository. Also, you could use multiple computers for the same project. Local files do not travel well. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you are collaborating with other people, you probably want to only pull when you have something working or have fixed a component, rather than just randomly pull requests. It helps you be more in control.
